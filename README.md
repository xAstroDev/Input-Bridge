i do not think this will work out of the box, it will likely need to be rewritten in some way. Contribute!

# The Purpose
I've seen some skepticism of this app, so i decided to decompile it for any malware analyst or java developer to take a look at it and help us make it "malware-free" if there is any. im no malware analyst, so feel free to help clean the source code of any "Malware" or anything suspicious.

# Contribute
im also accepting PRs to help compile an apk out of this
(mainly in github actions)

_maybe even add new features! :)_
